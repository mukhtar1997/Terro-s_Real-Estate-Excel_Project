# Terro's_Real-Estate-Excel_Project

# Problem Statement (Situation): 
# “Finding out the most relevant features for pricing of a house”
# Terro’s real-estate is an agency that estimates the pricing of houses in a certain locality. The pricing is 
# concluded based on different features / factors of a property. This also helps them in identifying the 
# business value of a property. To do this activity the company employs an “Auditor”, who studies 
# various geographic features of a property like pollution level (NOX), crime rate, education facilities 
# (pupil to teacher ratio), connectivity (distance from highway), etc. This helps in determining the price of a property.

# Objective (Task):
# Your job, as an auditor, is to analyze the magnitude of each variable to which it can affect the price of 
# a house in a particular locality
